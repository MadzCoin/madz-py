# Sirious-py
Sirious-py is a rpc and api wrapper.

First, install it via pip:
```
pip install sirious
```

All commands interfacing with the node need to use an Instance of `siriCoin()`

To create a new instance, run:
```
import sirious

siro = sirious.sirious()
```
Here are some commands you can use:
```
#                      Private key               From            To            Amount
print(siro.transaction("XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX", "0x4ba...b313", "0xbd...164", 1))
# returns False 

#                  Address
print(siro.balance("0x4ba...b313"))

#                     Address
print(siro.is_address("0x4ba...b313"))

```
